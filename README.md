## Game Engine

Reversed Golf Game:

Sure, here is the documentation of the game engine and the game created with the game engine:

**Game Engine**

The game engine is written in C++ and uses the following libraries:

* CMake: for building the project
* SDL: for creating a window
* OpenGL and GLEW: for rendering graphics
* GLM: for math
* stb_image: for loading image textures
* Assimp: for loading 3D models
* Python: for some miscellaneous tasks

The game engine supports the following features:

* Rendering 2D and 3D graphics
* Loading and displaying textures
* Loading and displaying 3D models
* Basic physics simulation
* Input handling

**Game**

The game is called "Golf, but you play as the hole". The player controls the hole and must try to hit the golf ball into the hole. The game features the following:

* Uneven terrain
* Physics simulation
* Path prediction
* Flagpole

**To start the game engine and the game:**

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the following command in the project directory:

```
cmake . && make
./game
```

The game will start and you can begin playing.

**Additional notes:**

* The game engine is still under development and there may be some bugs.
* The game is not very polished, but it is a working example of a game engine that can be used to create simple 2D and 3D games.

I hope this documentation is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions.
