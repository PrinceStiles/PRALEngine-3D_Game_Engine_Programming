//NOTE: The original implementation calls for using components of DirectMusic that haven't been shipped with DirectX since 2004.
//I haven't been able to find a proper copy of the necessary .lib file to include, so for now I'm going to just have to
//leave the DirectMusic bits commented out. Unfortunately, this means that this code will be non-functional, but I'm choosing not to
//worry about this, since I care more about learning how to handle the audio inside the engine than how to interface with Windows.
//MS interfaces are well-documented enough that I could work that part out on my own with a less-deprecated sound technology.
